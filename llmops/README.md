# Module Objectives

## Monitoring
- Implement real-time monitoring of GenAI models to ensure performance metrics are within acceptable parameters.

## Cost Tracking
- Develop a module for tracking operational costs associated with running GenAI models, including resource usage and cloud expenses.

## Drift Detection
- Create functionalities to detect data and model drift that can impact predictions, ensuring timely alerts and mitigations.

## Prompt Versioning
- Establish a system for versioning prompts used in GenAI applications, allowing for tracking changes and reproducibility.

## Embedding Lifecycle Management
- Provide mechanisms for managing the lifecycle of embeddings, including creation, update, and deprecation processes.

## CI/CD Blueprint for GenAI Pipelines
- Design a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) blueprint tailored for GenAI pipelines to streamline model deployment and updates.
