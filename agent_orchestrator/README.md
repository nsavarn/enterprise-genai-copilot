# Agent Orchestrator

## Module Objectives
- Clearly define and demarcate agent capabilities and their interactions.
- Facilitate effective communication between multiple agents for coordinated tasks.
- Establish a robust framework for managing agent workflows and objectives efficiently.

## Agentic Planning
- Implement planning strategies that allow agents to define their goals and the steps to achieve them autonomously.
- Integrate feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement of planning algorithms.

## Multi-Step Tool Invocation
- Provide agents with the capacity to invoke multiple tools in a single workflow to achieve complex objectives.
- Design patterns for sequencing and parallelizing tool invocations to enhance operational efficiency.

## Controlled Autonomy
- Define the spectrum of autonomy for agents, ensuring they function within defined parameters.
- Implement checks and balances to monitor and guide agent decision-making processes.

## Reasoning Traces
- Keep detailed logs of agent decision-making and actions taken for transparency and debugging.
- Utilize reasoning traces to enhance agent learning and adaptability.

## LangGraph Integration
- Explore the integration of LangGraph for enhanced language processing capabilities within agent development.
- Utilize LangGraph to create dynamic interactions and responses based on contextual understanding.
